    /*
    If I wanted to access this class somewhere else in my code I could do so by utilizing its fully qualified name:
    com.packages.Packages

    It's much easier to import classes than it is to constantly reference them by their fully qualified name:
    so we use the import keyword. Importing this class would look like this: import com.packages.Packages

    Please use your imports, only use fully qualified names when absolutely need to
